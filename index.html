                        <p>My passion for helping families plan is deeply personal. Before becoming an insurance professional, I spent five years as a Registered Behavior Technician, guiding families through life's complex challenges with patience and clear communication.</p>
                        <p>As someone who personally navigates life with sickle cell disease, I know firsthand the importance of planning ahead. My approach is not about selling a policy; it's about providing the education and empathetic support you need to make the best choice for your family. This is my calling.</p>
